# Poxedex

AJAX Pokédex
Practical Information

    Repository: ajax-pokedex
    Deadline: 2 days
    Delivery: Github page (published)
    Team: groups of 2

Learning Objectives

    A typical AJAX flow: send asynchronous requests to a remote server and process the results;
    JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format;
    DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on results of AJAX-requests.

Exercise

Make a Pokédex using this API.

Basic functionality that is expected (read: core features):

    You can search a pokémon by name and by ID
    Of said pokémon you need to show:
        The ID-number
        An image (sprite)
        At least 4 "moves"
        The previous evolution, only if it exists, along with their name and image

Make your web page look like a pokédex by adding a little CSS.

Note: For this exercise, the goal is to keep working on it, until the deadline is reached. If you are finished adding all "core features", look at what else the API has to offer, and try adding some other features. At the end of the deadline, everyone is going to present the pokédex they made; As such it is important that you have published your web page on GitHub!
